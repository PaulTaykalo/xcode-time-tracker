# Xcode Time Tracker
This is the tool that allows to track events that are happening in Xcode
This tool simply runs tracking scripts based on Xcode behaviors.
It's independent on the Xcode version (as soon as you have Xcode version higher than 4 :)
It will survive Xcode reinstallations, so it works on 'install and forget basis'

# Raw output example
The result of this tool will be one simple csv file looking like this
```
#ProjectName, Workspace, TimeStart, TimeEnd, Event, TimeSpent
No project,TimeTracker.xcworkspace,1497876725,1497876729,Build Succeeded,4
No project,TimeTracker.xcworkspace,1497876729,1497877067,Run Completed,338
No project,TimeTracker.xcworkspace,1497877067,1497877088,Build Succeeded,21
```

# Installation
There'are two installation steps: 
1) Place scripts to `~/.timecheck` directory
2) Setup Xcode behaviours to run those scripts on every run

## Scripts installation
Simply run 
```
CURRENT=`pwd`
cd `mktemp -d`
git clone https://github.com/PaulTaykalo/xcode-time-tracker
cd xcode-time-tracker
sh ./install.sh
cd ..
rm -rf xcode-time-tracker
cd $CURRENT
```
This will download and copy `project_start.py` and `project_end.py` to the `~/.timecheck` directory

## Xcode Behaviours setup

1) Edit Xcode Behaviors  
![Behaviors](https://github.com/PaulTaykalo/xcode-time-tracker/blob/images/images/behaviours.png?raw=true)
2) Set project_start.py script as custom script for start behaviors  
![Start Behaviors](https://github.com/PaulTaykalo/xcode-time-tracker/blob/images/images/start_script.png?raw=true)
3) Set project_end.py script as custom script for end behaviors  
![End Behaviors](https://github.com/PaulTaykalo/xcode-time-tracker/blob/images/images/end_script.png?raw=true)


## Next step
There are no more steps. Done.

## Check Installation
Build your precious project and see that there's new file appeared in `~/.timecheck` directory
It should contain line that should look like this
```
No project,HeyYouAreAwesome.xcworkspace,1597876725,1597876729,Build Succeeded,4
```

# Visualization

## Console
Run `ruby ~/.timecheck/report_time.rb`

This script will output the accumulated time you've spend building projects on Xcode within the current day, separated by project.
It will keep reporting updated times as soon as a build/run is finished.
To stop it, just use `Ctrl+C`

## Graphically
The next step is to visualize this information.
I used [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) language for that. But there's more coming
This how it can look like if you'll be able to setup R correcly :)
